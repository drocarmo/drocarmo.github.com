Learning how to create good design is a lot like learning how to play an instrument really well. You can’t just hop into Photoshop, create a new document and expect great things to happen after 2 hours of compounding layers. No one picks up a guitar and knows exactly where to put their fingers to play F Major to stroke the guitar a perfect melody.
### It Takes Understanding
Find out why some layouts are in a specific hierarchical pattern, why a designer would choose specific kerning and bold type, why a designer would make a background picture blurry, why a designer picked specific colors. There’s a melodic structure behind the art.
### It Takes Practice
Craft your skill. Let your design speak of great ingenuity. Open up a blank illustrator document and design for hours. That white box in the middle of the page is not your restricted canvas, scroll right, and draw outside of it if you have to. A friend of mine once said you can't call yourself anything unless you're a daily practicioner of it.

### It Takes Iteration
Some of my mentors and heroes in the design community have all in some fashion or another stated that ’the beauty of learning how to become a good designer, is that it never ends. You’re always crafting your creativity and revising your understanding of design’. [It’s an inception of endless repetitive goodness](http://24.media.tumblr.com/7eab607cdb06fcbfd9b198fcc6a4ec40/tumblr_mir0zi2HyM1s0xrqjo1_250.gif).
