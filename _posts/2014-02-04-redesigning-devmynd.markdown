For the past three weeks, [JC](https://twitter.com/thegrubbsian) and I have been working on redesigning DevMynd's website from scratch. I’ve been working on the front-end (HAML, Sass &#38; Javascript) and JC has been doing the heavy lifting (Rails &#38; Javascript).

I'm really excited to launch it today. Here’s how we built it:

### Goals

We had one personal goal and two business goals:

- We wanted to build a website that displayed the type of talent we have in the office, something that we could genuinely be proud of.
- We wanted to build a website that prioritized content. Our blog is a huge part of our traffic, we wanted to make reading our posts an enjoyable experience.
- We wanted to build a website that drove users to explore more. Each part of our website had to be thoroughly processed and optimized for SEO.

### Early Stages

During the early stages, we spent time figuring out what we wanted the new design to be and how it would match our goals.

I spent 3 days in Photoshop, mocking up what the initial pages would look like. After a few days, it became clear that moving layers two pixels left, not feeling good about it, and then moving it back wasn’t the right way to go about the re-design.

Thus, we closed Photoshop and just began building the site. Sure, the design was barely half done, but we knew that everything would become clearer as we got closer to the finish line. As I began building the interactions and getting feedback from our team, it became clear what worked and what didn’t.

### Process

Our process for building the website was quite simple:

- Define a specific section or problem on a page
- Ideate a possible solution
- Build the possible solution
- Test it
- Repeat

We designed and built the website from the ground up, mobile first. [Tony](https://twitter.com/tonycoco) was a huge help with advanced `SASS` techniques, and we used some outside resources such as [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) and [Glisse](http://glisse.victorcoulon.fr/).

### Final Product

You can see the final product at [devmynd.com](http://www.devmynd.com/). Our hope is that DevMynd’s new website reflects both what we believe in and who we are as a company. Check out our [values](http://www.devmynd.com/culture/values) to learn more about the DevMynd approach.
