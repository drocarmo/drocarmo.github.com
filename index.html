<div class="about">
  <h1>I'm Pedro Carmo.</h1>
  <p>A product designer living in Chicago, Illinois.</p>
  <div class="info-main images"></div>
  <p>Design is about people, their needs crossing paths with technology, cognitive science and a synthesis of beauty. Luckily, I get to solve those needs with the talented crew at <a href="http://www.devmynd.com/" target="_blank">DevMynd</a>.</p>
  <p>On my spare time, I mentor design and front-end students at <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/" target="_blank">StarterLeague</a>. Monthly, I take part in organizing <a href="http://creativemornings.com/cities/chi" target="_blank">CreativeMornings</a> in Chicago. I also enjoy snapping <a href="http://dro.vsco.co/" target="_blank">pictures</a> of my travels and occassionally pretending I can <a href="http://cdn.themetapicture.com/media/funny-gif-skate-board-accident-fail.gif" target="_blank">skate</a>.</p>
