        Hello internet friend, my name is Pedro Carmo.
        I was born in S√£o Paulo, Brasil but I‚Äôve lived most of my life in from Orlando, Florida.
        Currently, I live in Brooklyn, NY working as product designer at Kickstarter.
        At <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, I‚Äòm working on the Backing feature team and Design Systems team there. My focus is improving how our backers interact with and back a project checkout page and helping build and define our component library.
        <a href="https://medium.com/kickstarter-design/were-hiring-product-designers-54ddebb0523e" target="_blank">We're looking</a> for more product designers to join, so hit me up if you are looking!
      </h5>
      <h5>
        Before that, I was rolling up my sleeves in the consultancy world as a product designer at <a href="http://www.devmynd.com/" target="_blank">DevMynd</a>.
        Previously, I served as a product designer at <a href="https://www.teespring.com" target="_blank">Teespring</a>.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        In my downtime, I mentor Design 101 and Interaction Design students at <a href="http://trydesignlab.com/" target="_blank">Designlab</a>.
        Elsewhere, you can find me on as <b>@drocarmo</b> on <a href="https://twitter.com/drocarmo" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@drocarmo" target="_blank">Medium</a> and <a href="https://github.com/drocarmo" target="_blank">Github</a>. If you're into sending emails though, just remember <a href="mailto:pe@drocarmo.com?subject=Hey Pedro&amp;body=I was just on your website and..">to be nice</a>.
