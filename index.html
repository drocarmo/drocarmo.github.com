    <h2>Recent Work</h2>
    <p>
      I’m joining the talented product design team at <a href="https://www.simple.com" target="_blank">Simple</a>. They’re based in Portland but I’ll be working from my lovely apartment in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Simple, I was serving as Product Designer at <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> in Brooklyn, NY. I lead the Backing feature team there, designing the new checkout, project page and reward selection flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to moving to Brooklyn, I lived in San Francisco working as Product Designer at <a href="https://www.teespring.com" target="_blank">Teespring</a> in San Francisco, CA. At Teespring, I helped design & build their new homepage, creator storefronts, <a href="https://teespring.com/style-guide" target="_blank">design systems</a> and other product releases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previous to Teespring, I lived in Chicago, IL. I had the opportunity to roll up my sleeves in client product development shops such as <a href="http://www.devmynd.com/" target="_blank">DevMynd</a> and <a href="http://www.codal.com/" target="_blank">Codal</a> as Product Designer and UI Engineer, perspectively. In Chicago, I also went to a tech school called <a href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/starter-league" target="_blank">StarterLeague</a> where I graduated in a Visual Design and a Frontend Development program.

    <h2>Side projects</h2>
    <p>
      As a labor of love, I maintain a library of <a href="http://drocarmo.com/resources/" target="_blank">Product Design Resources</a>. I share a lot of these resources with the students I mentor in the Design 101 and Interaction Design courses at <a href="http://trydesignlab.com/" target="_blank">Designlab</a>. I also built a chrome-extension app called <a href="http://drocarmo.com/elenco/" target="_blank">Elenco</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also always available to hire for freelance work, so don't hesitate to reach out.
