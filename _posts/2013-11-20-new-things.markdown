Today, I’m incredibly stoked to announce that I will be joining the amazing team at DevMynd as Product Designer!

I am excited to began building products with the team here, but the coolest part about joining the team so far has been the support and culture behind it all.

The support I’ve received from tech friends in the Chicago community during this process has been so encouraging. It's clear that DevMynd shaping the tech culture here in Chicago.

### The Process

Earlier this year, one of my good friends, [Greg](https://twitter.com/vgdub), gave me some incredible advice. _Set a goal_ and a _deadline_ for yourself, then _work hard_ to be ready for when that goal approaches itself. My goal was to join a great company with talent and purpose in the Chicago community.

A couple of months down the road, I found out about DevMynd’s design opportunity through a friend, [Shay](https://twitter.com/shayhowe). After reaching out to [JC](https://twitter.com/thegrubbsian) and the DevMynd crew, it was quickly clear to me that they were building something awesome here in Chicago.

After a few meetings and design challenges, I was confident that DevMynd was the exact opportunity I was looking for, luckily, JC and the team felt the same way.

### What's Next

I believe a developer/designer’s role in the world is not only to learn how to better communicate with computers. More importantly, I believe our role is to better understand humanity as a whole and use technology as a medium to solve problems that exist in our lives.

Be on the look out for what we build here at DevMynd. I promise it will be good.
