It's a human desideratum to make mistakes, to experience failure. Without it, we risk never experiencing true iterative growth.

Lately, I've noticed a building amount of pressure on the web amongst the design community. From _Dribbble_ posts, to _Medium_ accounts, to _Behance_ portfolios, to you name it. There's this subliminally unattainable goal to be presumably perfect. This isn't anything new, it's almost DNA'd into our nature.

There's one undeniable truth here though, you and I aren't perfect. Yet, we try so hard to make our work _look_ perfect. We idolize the work of our favorite designers, but we forget there's a process in their work, a process full of mistakes. The work of those designers are great because they spent time appreciating the mistake and understanding how to make that mistake into something purposeful.

Mistakes are a part of our iterative craft. A mistake teaches you a lot about how you can approach a problem differently the next time you encounter it. Mistakes are progressive experiences.

Mistakes can teach you a lot about the software you're using, the limitations of the software, the capabilities of it, the creativity you can expand on it. Mistakes can teach you a lot about the people you are building a product for, a lot about what they hate about your design and a lot about what they enjoy about it.

Mistakes can be painful, or an accidental success. Regardless, there's something you can learn from it. Embrace them and allow them to show. You are not perfect.
