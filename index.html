<div class="about">
  <h1>Hi, I'm Pedro Carmo.</h1>
  <p>I'm a digital designer living in Chicago, Illinois.</p>
  <div class="info-main images"></div>
  <p>I work as lead Product Designer at a development studio by the name of <a href="http://codal.com/" target="_blank">Codal</a>. Whether building an application, re-designing a website or crafting a logo, I'm building a digital product. Most importantly, a product people will use and interact with. Understanding that interaction is why I'm passionate about design and why I build products.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>During my evenings, I mentor design students at a school called <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/" target="_blank">StarterLeague</a>. I took a few courses there some time ago, it always feels good to give back to the community what it gave to you. On some friday mornings, I take part in organizing a monthly breakfast event called <a href="http://creativemornings.com/cities/chi" target="_blank">CreativeMornings</a>, it's usually the guy giving out way too many high fives.</p>
  <p>On spare time, I enjoy pretending that I'm a professional <a href="http://dro.vsco.co/" target="_blank">photographer</a>, I'm always trying to up my collection game on <i>Rdio</i> and am probably the worst person at finishing books, but I've managed to read a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}books">few</a>.</p>

  <p>I'm always taking on projects or passing them along to talented friends. So if you wanna work on something, or have something for me to work on, <a href="mailto:pe@drocarmo.com?subject=Hey Pedro&body=I was just on your website and..">don't hesitate</a>.</p>
