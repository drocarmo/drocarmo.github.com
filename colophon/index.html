<div class="about">
	<h1>Colophon</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Designed and built by myself, at a coffee shop, somewhere. All of the code is public, and can be seen or used <a href="https://github.com/drocarmo/drocarmo.github.com" target="_blank">here</a>. Just make sure to give credit where it's due if you want to use anything (that goes for rest of the internet too, rookie).</p>
	<p>Built in HTML, Sass and Javascript, generated and maintained with Jekyll. Typefaces include Rooney Web and Rooney Sans by <a href="http://www.janfromm.de/" target="_blank">Jan Fromm</a>, and Minion Pro by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Slimbach" target="_blank">Robert Slimbach</a>.</p>
	<p>A special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/vgdub" target="_blank">Greg</a> for all of the help during the Ruby and Jekyll configuration process. Also, thanks to some friends who inspire me on regular basis: <a href="https://twitter.com/robbschiller" target="_blank">Robb</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/migreyes">Mig</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KnoedCreative" target="_blank">Kyle+Kim</a>, all of the StarterLeague family and all of team at CreativeMornings.</p>
