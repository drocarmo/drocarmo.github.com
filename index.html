<div class="about">
  <h1>I'm Pedro Carmo.</h1>
  <p>A digital product designer living in Chicago, Illinois.</p>
  <div class="info-main images"></div>
  <p>Designing and building the web is what I love doing. I was fortunate enough to have mentors teach me to always seek the <i>why</i> of problems, not only the <i>what</i>. So, when designing, I strive to find the perfect medium in design to communicate a product to the user. My rule of thumb in design is: <i>design is about how a product works, not just about how it looks.</i></p>

  <p>During my evenings, I mentor design students at a school called <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/" target="_blank">StarterLeague</a>. I took a few courses there some time ago, it always feels good to give back to the community what it gave to you. On some friday mornings, I take part in organizing a monthly breakfast event called <a href="http://creativemornings.com/cities/chi" target="_blank">CreativeMornings</a>, I'm usually the guy giving out way too many high fives.</p>
  <p>On spare time, I enjoy pretending that I'm a professional <a href="http://dro.vsco.co/" target="_blank">photographer</a>, I'm always trying to up my collection game on <i>Rdio</i> and am probably the worst person at finishing books, but I've managed to read a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}books">few</a>.</p>
