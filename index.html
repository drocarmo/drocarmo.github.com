        Hello internet friend, my name is Pedro Carmo. I was born in São Paulo, Brasil but I’ve lived most of my life in Orlando, Florida. Currently, I live in Brooklyn, NY working as product designer at Kickstarter. At <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, I work on the Backing feature team and the Design Systems team. My focus on the Backing team is to improve how our backers interact with the project page, rewards selection and checkout page. In the Design Systems team, I’m helping build, define process and maintain our pattern and component library. <a href="https://medium.com/kickstarter-design/were-hiring-product-designers-54ddebb0523e" target="_blank">We're looking</a> for more product designers to join, so hit me up if you are looking!

        Previously, I served as a product designer at a e-commerce startup called <a href="https://www.teespring.com" target="_blank">Teespring</a>. Before that, I was rolling up my sleeves in the consultancy world as a product designer at <a href="http://www.devmynd.com/" target="_blank">DevMynd</a>.

        In my downtime, I mentor Design 101 and Interaction Design students at <a href="http://trydesignlab.com/" target="_blank">Designlab</a>. Elsewhere, you can find me on as <b>@drocarmo</b> on <a href="https://twitter.com/drocarmo" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@drocarmo" target="_blank">Medium</a> and <a href="https://github.com/drocarmo" target="_blank">Github</a>. If you're into sending emails though, just remember <a href="mailto:pe@drocarmo.com?subject=Hey Pedro&amp;body=I was just on your website and..">to be nice</a>.
