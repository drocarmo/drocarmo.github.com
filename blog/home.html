99% of People Lie
    </h2>
    <p class="posts">
First and foremost,
<br>
It is 2:33 am. So forgive my grammatical errors.
<br>
This is a blog entry in response to @Erondu's blog entry "You are Your Number One User" & "Go Out and Do Nothing" on Svbtle. So go read that first for inspiration, I guess. Then go write a blog entry on your inspiration. Then come back here, and read this.
<br>
Back? Awesome. Whew!
<br>
Ok, so some back drop to get you updated with the past 12 hours.
<br>
I am fairly new to the tech community. Self-taught for the past 4 months, and now a student at StarterLeague. A quick explanation of why I got into web development is because pixel pushing and code puzzling challenging me to solve problems in an incredibly creative platform (designing and building the web).
<br>
So back to now, I am currently in 1871 Studio, hacking away my brain from learning JS library assets to pixel pushing in Photoshop. I have drank my share of caffeine and sleep is no longer in sight, so on my midnight snack break I was scrolling through my twitter feed and Jared's post caught my eye.
<br>
After reading Jared's post, I decided to extend my snack period because it was truly what I needed. I decided to ride around 1871 with the many Razor Scooters in the facility and then sat down to do some writing. As my writing developed, an increasing desire to go back to my computer to do "work" kept tugging inside of me. I kept writing and that's when a lot became clear to me (Somewhat like Jared's 'That's when it hit me' moment).
<br>
Conclusion: 99.9% of people lie about their creativity.
<br>
Now, hold on, before you pull out your linkedin profiles, with great resumes of what you've accomplished, just hear me out. The 0.1% are those whose pursuit is much similar to Salvador Dali's quote:
<br>
"Have no fear of perfection, you'll never reach it."
<br>
What I am trying to say is, there's enough spark in each one of us to create the most creative creation. That was a lot, and maybe unnecessary, but try to picture it like a 'think outside the box' situation:
<br>
There's a box made of steel held shut by nails has tons of gold inside. Approach?
<br>
99% -> Continuously tries to break the box open by throwing it on the ground and walls. 
<br>
1% -> Uses the box as a lift to get the wrench in the top cabin and opens the box.
<br>
We are all liars, hindering our potential by doing simply what we've been programmed to do. The fear of no longer knowing if it will workout is one of the greatest fears I've grown to know. What could go wrong if there is no cement to land on and no ceiling to touch?
<br>
As I learn more about what it means to be a creative designer and a creative developer or a creative human as it is, I want to be able to learn how to solve problems the most efficient way for my user experience and ultimately everyone else's. Not the most feasible way in order to gain someone's regards.
