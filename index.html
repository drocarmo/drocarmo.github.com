      <b>
        <p>Born in São Paulo, Brazil but spent most of his adult years as an immigrant in the USA — where he studied &amp; developed his skills in technology as a designer. Currently, he resides in Miami Beach, Florida.
      </b>
      <b>
        <p>For the past 5 years, Pedro has been designing at <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack Technologies</a> as Principal Product Designer. He leads the Core Mobile design organization to deliver &amp; guide innovative product solutions to their 20+ million weekly active users.</p>
      </b>
      <p>He’s spearheaded the design for several of Slack's most successful products such as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-future-of-slack-looks-a-lot-like-zoom/" target="_blank">Huddles</a> — which became their fastest growing feature since the launch of Threads. Other notable features he's designed include: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685576/slack-clips-video-messages-feature" target="_blank">Audio & Video Clips</a>, <a href="https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/new-emoji-pack-to-help-with-your-remote-work-balance" target="_blank">Emoji Packs</a>, <a href="https://x.com/drocarmo/status/1370236859423485953" target="_blank">Reacji Solidarity</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/22/24203924/slack-iphone-ipad-ios-ipados-widgets" target="_blank">Widgets</a> &amp; most recently <a href="https://startups.co.uk/news/slack-lists/" target="_blank">Lists</a> — a new tool for tracking work, managing requests, &amp; coordinating cross-functional projects within Slack's communication flow.</p>
      <p>Prior to Slack, he led design in various capacities for other technology companies such as <a href="https://envoy.com/" target="_blank">Envoy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_(bank)" target="_blank">Simple Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> &amp; <a href="https://teespring.com/" target="_blank">Spring</a>. Outside of work, Pedro’s passions include traveling, reading &amp; photography, particularly using traditional film &amp; digital cameras like the Ricoh GR III &amp; Fujifilm X-T30. He also enjoys playing chess, running half marathons, playing soccer &amp; exploring the culinary arts through cooking classes.</p>
