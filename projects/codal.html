I joined a team made up of myself, one front-end developer, one UX designer and one marketing strategist. Leading the team in Design, I created the logo in Maven Pro type, tweaking the kerning and shape of some letters in Illustrator. I created all of the assets, including typography choice, color palettes, layout and grid. I also wrote most of the HTML/CSS/Javascript including all responsive design.</p>
