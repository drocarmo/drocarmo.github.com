I"Ş<p>Itâ€™s a human desideratum to make mistakes, to experience failure. Without it, we risk never experiencing true iterative growth.</p>

  <p>â€œIf youâ€™re not making mistakes, then youâ€™re not doing anything. Iâ€™m positive that a doer makes mistakes.â€</p>

  <p>â€” John Wooden</p>

<p>Lately, Iâ€™ve noticed a building amount of pressure on the web amongst the design community. From <em>Dribbble</em> posts, to <em>Medium</em> accounts, to <em>Behance</em> portfolios, to you name it. Thereâ€™s this subliminally unattainable goal to be presumably perfect. This isnâ€™t anything new, itâ€™s almost DNAâ€™d into our nature.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s one undeniable truth here though, you and I arenâ€™t perfect. Yet, we try so hard to make our work <em>look</em> perfect. We idolize the work of our favorite designers, but we forget thereâ€™s a process in their work, a process full of mistakes. The work of those designers are great because they spent time appreciating the mistake and understanding how to make that mistake into something purposeful.</p>

<p>Mistakes are a part of our iterative craft. A mistake teaches you a lot about how you can approach a problem differently the next time you encounter it. Mistakes are progressive experiences.</p>

<p>Mistakes can teach you a lot about the software youâ€™re using, the limitations of the software, the capabilities of it, the creativity you can expand on it. Mistakes can teach you a lot about the people you are building a product for, a lot about what they hate about your design and a lot about what they enjoy about it.</p>

<p>Mistakes can be painful, or an accidental success. Regardless, thereâ€™s something you can learn from it. Embrace them and allow them to show. You are not perfect.</p>
