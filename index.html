Other notable features he’s designed include <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685576/slack-clips-video-messages-feature" target="_blank">Audio & Video Clips</a>, <a href="https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/new-emoji-pack-to-help-with-your-remote-work-balance" target="_blank">Emoji Packs</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/22/24203924/slack-iphone-ipad-ios-ipados-widgets" target="_blank">Widgets</a> &amp; most recently <a href="https://startups.co.uk/news/slack-lists/" target="_blank">Lists</a> — Slack’s brand new capability to track work, triage requests, and manage cross-functional projects in the flow of communication.</p>
      </b>

Outside of work, Pedro’s hobbies include traveling, reading, photography with traditional film, Ricoh GR III or Fujifilm X-T30, creating art collages, running half marathons, playing soccer &amp; taking culinary classes.</p>
