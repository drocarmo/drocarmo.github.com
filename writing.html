      <h2><a href="#design-is-hard">Design is Hard</a></h2>
      <h4>March 3rd, 2013</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"You recognize great design when you see it, but creating it yourself is hard."</p>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/studiofellow" target="_blank">Jarrod Drysdale</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <br>
      <p>Learning how to create good design is a lot like learning how to play an instrument really well. You can’t just hop into Photoshop, create a new document and expect great things to happen after 2 hours of compounding layers. No one picks up a guitar and knows exactly where to put their fingers to play F Major to stroke the guitar a perfect melody.</p>
      <h3>It Takes Understanding</h3>
      <p>Find out why some layouts are in a specific hierarchical pattern, why a designer would choose specific kerning and bold type, why a designer would make a background picture blurry, why a designer picked specific colors. There’s a melodic structure behind the art.</p>
      <h3>It Takes Practice</h3>
      <p>Craft your skill. Let your design speak of great ingenuity. Open up a blank illustrator document and design for hours. That white box in the middle of the page is not your restricted canvas, scroll right, and draw outside of it if you have to. A friend of mine once said you can't call yourself anything unless you're a daily practicioner of it. <a href="http://arvindang.com/post/40772534683/ugly-is-part-of-the-process" target="_blank">Remember: “Ugly is part of the process".</a></p>
      <h3>It Takes Iteration</h3>
      <p>Some of my mentors and heroes in the design community have all in some fashion or another stated that ’the beauty of learning how to become a good designer, is that it never ends. You’re always crafting your creativity and revising your understanding of design’. <a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/7eab607cdb06fcbfd9b198fcc6a4ec40/tumblr_mir0zi2HyM1s0xrqjo1_250.gif" target="_blank">It’s an inception of endless repetitive goodness.</a></p>

      <h2><a href="#write-for-the-sake-of-writing">Write, For The Sake Of Writing</a></h2>
      <h4>February 2nd, 2013</h4>
      <p>Hi there web, it has been quite some time since I’ve published anything on the web in terms of writing.
      The reason isn’t due to a lack of content. The past 2 months have been an incredible time of learning. As a design student at <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/" target="_blank">StarterLeague</a> there has been no shortage of things to write about when learning with <a href="http://migreyes.com/" target="_blank">Mig</a>, mentors, fellow students and the Chicago community.</p>
      <h3>Houston, We Have A Problem</h3>
      <p>The problem is I find myself making the typical mental notes that any blog writer makes once crossing paths with a deep thought: “Oh, I should totally post a blog entry about this” or “Is it worth posting about?”. These mental notes usually end up discouraging my desire to write anything at all. It also hinders my entire creative process as a writer.</p>
      <p><a href="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_madccyqtJT1qeewh2.gif" target="_blank">How?</a></p>
      <p>Now, I am no longer freely writing about a topic that has intrigued me enough to sit down and write/type about. My thoughts are constantly bouncing back and forth between two connections. The connection between my mind and the paper/screen, and the connection between the screen and the reader. I’m perpetually  rechecking grammar, making sure thoughts are clear, etc etc.</p>
      <h3>Writing Is Good</h3>
      <p>Writing is an art, a gift. It’s not meant to be robotic or planned out. One of my favorite writing sessions I’ve ever experienced was with a pencil and a journal, I wrote to never look back at it again. Write to just for the sake of writing. It rewarding to the soul, trust me.</p>
      <p>This writing was ironically never meant to reach the web but thoughts are meant to be shared. Not all are meant to end up in your 8th grade journal in the closet of your parents house.</p>
      <h3>Be Vulnerable</h3>
      <p>The interesting lesson this writing taught me was the same way I was obstructing my creative writing by thinking about how others may judge it, the same way about my design. What if I had an illustrative idea about a design and immediately thought.. “Ooh, I should make it 800 pixels wide and 600 pixels high pixels in Photoshop then post it on dribbble”. See where I’m getting at?</p>
      <p>There’s a sacred part about writing, designing or coding that’s called the (<a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/06/01/153885491/the-creative-process" target="_blank">creative</a>) process. That process should never be hindered by pressure, judgement or expectations. The process is meant to be a vulnerable time to express any ideas.</p>
      <p>Therefore, write to just simply have a relationship with a pen and paper. Design to just simply make something beautifully structured. Code to just simply make cool ideas come to life on the web. Embrace and explore the process, (maybe) let the rest of the world in later, focus on the connection between your mind and the art. Also, don’t follow me if you’re expecting more writings, sorry.</p>

      <h4>January 11th, 2013</h4>
      <p>First and foremost, it is 2:33 am. So forgive my grammatical errors.</p>
      <p>This is a blog entry in response to <a href="https://twitter.com/erondu" target="_blank">@Erondu’s</a> blog entry <a href="http://blog.jarederondu.com/you-are-your-number-one-user" target="_blank">"You are Your Number One User"</a> & <a href="http://blog.jarederondu.com/go-outside-and-do-nothing" target="_blank">"Go Out and Do Nothing"</a> on Svbtle. So go read that first for inspiration, I guess. Then go write a blog entry on your inspiration. Then come back here, and read this.</p>
      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>Back? Awesome. Whew!</p>
      <p>Ok, so some back drop to get you updated with the past 12 hours.</p>
      <p>I am fairly new to the tech community. Self-taught for the past 4 months, and now a student at <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/" target="_blank">StarterLeague</a>. A quick explanation of why I got into web development is because pixel pushing and code puzzling challenging me to solve problems in an incredibly creative platform (designing and building the web).</p>
      <h3>Too Much Caffeine</h3>
      <p>So back to now, I am currently in the <a href="http://1871.com" target="_blank">1871 Workspace</a>, hacking away my brain from learning JS library assets to pixel pushing in Photoshop. I have drank my share of caffeine and sleep is no longer in sight, so on my midnight snack break I was scrolling through my twitter feed and Jared’s post caught my eye.</p>
      <p>After reading Jared’s post, I decided to extend my snack period because it was truly what I needed. I decided to ride around 1871 with the many <a href="https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6687127040/hD56DB022/" target="_blank">Razor Scooters</a> in the facility and then sat down to do some writing. As my writing developed, an increasing desire to go back to my computer to do “work" kept tugging inside of me. I kept writing and that’s when a lot became clear to me (Somewhat like Jared’s ‘That’s when it hit me’ moment).</p>
      <h3>No Fear of Perfection</h3>
      <p>Conclusion: 99.9% of people lie about their creativity.</p>
      <p>Now, hold on, before you pull out your linkedin profiles, with great resumes of what you’ve accomplished, just hear me out. The 0.1% are those whose pursuit is much similar to Salvador Dali’s quote:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Have no fear of perfection, you’ll never reach it."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>What I am trying to say is, there’s enough spark in each one of us to create the most creative creation. That was a lot, and maybe unnecessary, but try to picture it like a ‘think outside the box’ situation:</p>
      <p>There’s a box made of steel held shut by nails has tons of gold inside. What would be you're initial approach?</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>99%  -> Continuously tries to break the box open by throwing it on the ground and walls. 
        1% -> Spots a wrench up in the top shelf and uses the box as a lift to get it.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We are all liars, hindering our potential by doing simply what we’ve been programmed to do. The fear of no longer knowing if it will workout is one of the greatest fears I’ve grown to know. What could go wrong if there is no cement to land on and no ceiling to touch?</p>
      <p>As I learn more about what it means to be a creative designer and a creative developer or a creative human as it is, I want to be able to learn how to solve problems the most efficient way for my user experience and ultimately everyone else’s. Not the most feasible way in order to gain someone’s regards.</p>
